Many teams track Actual vs Budget, but still struggle to answer the real business question:
👉 “WHY are we over/under budget, and what should we do next?”

So I built this Actual vs Budget Executive Dashboard in Power BI to move beyond reporting and into decision-making.
🧩 The Problem I Solved : 
✔️Financial data was scattered across years, months, and projects
✔️Leaders couldn’t quickly identify which projects were driving variance
✔️Budget overruns were visible, but root causes were not.

🔍 3 Key Insights from the Dashboard :
1️⃣ Income Risk Is Project-Specific, Not Global :
While overall income performance looks stable, certain projects (e.g. 1054) consistently miss budget targets by 40%+, indicating pricing or delivery inefficiencies.

2️⃣ Expense Control Is Stronger Than Revenue Realization :
Across years, expense utilization stays mostly within 90–93%, suggesting cost discipline, but revenue leakage is impacting profitability.

3️⃣ Variance Trends Matter More Than Single Months :
Yearly views reveal recurring underperformance in specific periods, which would be missed in a month-only analysis.

🛠 Improvement Recommendations
✔ Introduce project-level income forecasting instead of annual-only targets
 ✔ Flag early-warning variance thresholds (e.g. <95% budget utilization)
 ✔ Combine this with margin & profitability KPIs for true financial health tracking
